# Atom LenientJS

Atom package which enables Lenient syntax for JavaScript.

After installing this package, open a JS file and run `Set Syntax: Lenient JS` from command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS), in case the syntax wasn't selected automatically.

When enabled, the code will be presented in Lenient syntax, but saved as pretty-printed standard JavaScript.

If you want to use Lenient syntax by default, disable Babel or any other package you're currently using for syntax highlighting JavaScript.
